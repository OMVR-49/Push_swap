## Introduction

The Push Swap project requires sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an algorithm that sorts the stack with the minimum possible number of operations.

## Learning-Objectives

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Gain experience in implementing a sorting algorithm tailored for a specific scenario with limited operations.

- **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Explore strategies to minimize the number of operations and optimize your sorting algorithm.

- **Problem Solving:** Develop a strategy to manipulate the stack effectively and achieve the desired order.

- **C Programming:** Apply and reinforce your C programming skills, including memory management, pointers, and other fundamental concepts.

- **Debugging Skills:** Hone your debugging skills by addressing and resolving bugs and issues that may arise during development.

- **Coding Standards:** Adhere to coding standards and norms to produce clean, maintainable code.

- **Algorithmic Complexity:** Understand the trade-offs between different sorting algorithms, considering time and space complexity.

[Visit My Notion](https://www.notion.so/PUSH_SWAP-7d6bb7d9575b44f1817cffad712b011e) Maybe there would be some bad words while i was explaining to my self XD btw it's written in Darija of Morocco Not in English


## Usage

```bash
make
./push_swap [list_of_integers]
